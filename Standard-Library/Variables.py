#First of all, let's define a variable name, for example
numberOfTheBeast = 666
#So, now you have a variable and it "contains" a value that i chose (but you can change as well)
#Now check if it's correct with aprint function
print(numberOfTheBeast)

#The triple apostrophe is also a way to write comments, useful for mutiple lines
 
#Let me show some other applications for variables on python
sayMyName = 'Heisenberg' #When defining the value of the variable as a string don't forget to use single quotes
print(sayMyName)
